A horde of hungry opponents approaches fast! Pull as many carrots as you can in 3 minutes. To fight your opponents, you must use ancient rabbitjutsu tactics. These are slightly unorthodox. Simply uhm ... fart to push your opponents away or use a Carrot-on-a-Fork totem decoy to deceive them. The totem is spawned on your current position.",
